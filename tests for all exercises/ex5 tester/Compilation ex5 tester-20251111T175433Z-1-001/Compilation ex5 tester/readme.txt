***NOTE***:
Currently the tester ignores empty new lines.
The tester also ignores SPACES. Please make sure you do print a space after a PrintInt call 
as required. 

Instructions:

Put the entire 'tester' folder under compilation/ex5
cd into said tester folder.
run:
java Tester


If you want to change the tester, edit Tester.java
run:
javac Tester.java
To compile it.


If you wish to add more test cases:
Name the input file: inputX.txt and place it into the inputs folder. Where X is a number.
Make a corresponding expected_outX.txt in the expected_outputs folder.


***If you make new test cases, please share them with me directly so we can all benefit.***
